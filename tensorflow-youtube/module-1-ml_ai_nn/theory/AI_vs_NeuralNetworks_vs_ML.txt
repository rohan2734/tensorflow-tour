* AI : 
  > effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
  > ML figures out the rules for us

* ML : 
  > rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us

* Neural Networks or Deep learning :
  > a form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data

* Data is important with machine learning and neural networks
