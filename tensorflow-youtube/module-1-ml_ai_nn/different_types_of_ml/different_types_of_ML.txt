different types of  ML 
 > unsupervised learning
 > supervised learning
 > reinforcement learning


* supervised learning 

 > features correspond to label

 > the reason it is called supervised,
 > we pass the input information, and we make arbitary output, and it compares the label,so we supervise the model, and we tweak it , if we want more better data
 
 > ex predict students final grade, model predicted as 76, instead of 77 , then we will tweak it little bit, and model will be in correct direction,

* unsupervised learning

 > it  has only features, and no labels and no outputs,
 > we want the model to come up with the labels and outputs

* reinforcement learning 

 > here we dont have data, we have agent , and environment , and reward
 > ex, 
 > 
 > it figures out the way ,explores different ways and reaches the flag
 > in this way, we dont need data, it learns by itself
