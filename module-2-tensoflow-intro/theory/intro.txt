* tensorflow is largest open source machine learning library

Graph:
* what we do when we write code in tensorflow is, we create a graph, when we create a variable ,it is added to graph,
  now that variable may be the summation of two other variables,

*  th reason it is graph, because , different computations can be related to each other,
   for ex,
   if we want to figure out value of v1, but vector 1, = sum of vector v2 and vector v3, then we need to know the sum of v2 and  v3, before i can do the v2 computations

session:
* it is  a way to execute part or entire part of graph, 
* when we start a session,we start from the end, where nothing is dependent on anythign else, we may have constant values, and we go to partial computation process

* tensors: 
 * it is a vector generalized to higher dimensions
 * it is kind of a data point
 * vector can have any amount of dimensions
 * tensor is a generalizaiton of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensiones internally
 * tensorflow represents tensors as n dimension arrays of base datatypes.

 * it is the main object, we will be viewing, manipulating, and itis the main object that is passed around the program
 * when we creat a program, we create a tensor, and it stores partially defined computation in the graph.
 * each tensor had data type and shape
 * data type, means what kind of information is stored
 * shape is representation  of tensor in temrs of what dimension is.

* string,number , floating has shape of 1, which means they are sacaler, which means they are only one value,
when we talk about vector , they are more than 1 values, and when we talk about matrices, they go up mich higher

* Rank/Degree of tensors
 * means the number of dimensions involved in the tensor
 * the above string, number, floating, has rank 0, which means they are scalar, because it is simply one thing, it doesnt have any dimension
