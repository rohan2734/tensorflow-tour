it mimics the working of a biological neutron

and its input will be values of features

the inputs are multiplied by some sort of weights

and the weights are random numbers,

inputs are  multiplied by weights and passsed through activation function

activation function:
ex :
if sum of inputs is positive , then return 1
else if negative, return 0

12*0.5 = 6
4*-1=-4

6-4>0 ,return 1

what if the inuts are 0?, then we have a problem, that we always get 0,
we can fix this by adding a bias term, we chose +1


once we have many perceptrons, we can extend it into matrix form
