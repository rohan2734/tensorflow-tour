supervised learning:

uses labelled data to predict a label given some features

if label is continuos , it is regression problem, else its categorical problem


classification problem :
features : height and weigt
label: gender

task: given  a persons height ,weight, predict gender

supervised learning -regression

features - square footage,rooms
label house price (diffrence is label is not categorical , it is continuos)

given house size, numnber of rooms , predit selling price

x-axis -square features
y-axis - price

supervised learning has the model train on historical data, that is already labelled (previous house sales)

once the model is trained, it can be used on new data, where only features are known, to attempt prediction

unsupervised learning

if you dont have historical data (dont have labels, but only have features)

we nneed to look for patterns and find structure, since we dont have labels

ex:
clustering
features : heights and weight for breed of dogs
label: no label for unsupervised

task :
cluster together data into similar groups, it is then upto data scientist , to interpret the clusters

Machine learning tasks :
computer learning to play video, or dive a car

it works through trail and error, like which actions yeilds greatest results

components:
agent -learning/decision maker
envirionment - what agent interacts with 
actions -what the agent will do

process
The agent chooses actions that maximises with some specific reward metric over a given amount of time

common test split ratio is 30%

supervised learning - regression eval

MAE , MSE , RMSE
